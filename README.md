# final-year-progect-mangement-web-application
This project involves the design and development of a web application solution that aims to handle the planning and organization of Final Year Projects (FYPs) for both Bachelor and Master degree courses. The system aims to overcome some of the weaknesses of the existing method of management of FYPs.

The system provides functionalities for administrators to handle themes for projects, allocate projects for student groups, handle defense schedules for thesis, and allocate jury members systematically. Students can view project themes offered, choose themes for their preferred projects, check defense schedules, and get results for their assessments. Members of the jury are given special platforms to evaluate students, enter marks, add comments, and create assessment evaluation reports.

The system is designed based on the UML paradigm, and this is for the purpose of performing an analysis of functional and non-functional requirements. Additionally, it uses an MVC architecture design so as to increase maintainability and scalability. Lastly, the system is developed based on modern web technologies, and these include HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL.
