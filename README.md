# final-year-progect-mangement-web-application
This project focuses on the design and development of a web-based application intended to manage the planning and organization of Final Year Projects (FYP) for Bachelor (Licence) and Master degree programs. The system addresses the limitations of traditional, manual management methods by providing a centralized, automated, and reliable platform.

The application enables administrators to manage project themes, assign projects to student groups, schedule thesis defenses, and allocate jury members efficiently. Students can consult available project topics, select their preferred themes, view defense schedules, and access their evaluation results. Jury members are provided with dedicated interfaces to evaluate students, submit grades, add remarks, and generate official evaluation reports.

The system is designed using the UML methodology to ensure a structured and clear analysis of functional and non-functional requirements. It follows the MVC (Model–View–Controller) architectural pattern to enhance maintainability, scalability, and code organization. The application is developed using modern web technologies, including HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL.

By automating the planning and management of final-year projects and defenses, this platform improves communication between stakeholders, reduces administrative errors, optimizes time management, and enhances transparency within academic institutions.
